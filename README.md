## Overview

### Description

The project involves creating a website that integrates with the Clean URI API to generate shortened URLs and display them as per the provided designs. The website will be built using React for the front-end and styled with Tailwind CSS. Users can shorten any valid URL, view a list of their shortened links even after refreshing the browser, and copy the shortened link to their clipboard with a single click. The site will display error messages if the input field is empty upon submission and adapt the interface layout based on the device's screen size. Additionally, hover and focus states will be implemented for all interactive elements.
